Introduction
Customer segmentation involves grouping customers with similar characteristics together. K-Means clustering is a popular unsupervised machine learning algorithm used for clustering tasks. In this project, we utilize K-Means clustering to group customers based on their purchase history, specifically focusing on two features: amount spent and frequency of purchases.

Dataset
The dataset used in this project consists of customer purchase history. Each data point contains information about the amount spent by a customer and the frequency of their purchases. The dataset is preprocessed to ensure proper scaling and formatting before applying the K-Means algorithm.

Installation
To run this project locally, follow these steps:

git clone https://github.com/sivanji05/customer-segmentation.git

Usage
Once you have installed the dependencies, you can run the main script to perform customer segmentation using K-Means clustering. Modify the dataset or parameters as needed for your specific use case.

python customer_segmentation.py

Results
After running the script, you will obtain the cluster centroids and labels. These results provide insights into different customer segments based on their purchase behavior. You can further analyze and interpret these segments to inform marketing strategies and business decisions.
